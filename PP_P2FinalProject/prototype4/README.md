**Prototype 4 Description**  

This prototype handles the browser interface for our tiles prototype.   
We have HTML, CSS, Arduino, and JS files that allow the user to click on different shapes on the grid of tiles and change the color of the selected shape element.  

These shapes represent the tiles that will be activated in our physical prototype by a user stepping or pushing down on the tiles.  
The user can also press buttons on an arduino board to change both the brightness of the LED and change the colors of each row of the GUI.   
The user can also input a number between 1-4 in the input field of the GUI to turn on the LED on the arduino and change the brightness level. If the user inputs 5, the LED turns off.  

**Go to Iteration 3 for finalized code**
