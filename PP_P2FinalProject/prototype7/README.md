**This prototype works with motion-stream connected with a smartphone and it changes the color of the background in four nuances of green. Starting from light to dark, which represents how brightness is manipulated with motion-stream. ALpha, beta, gamma are used to indicate the exact position of the phone in the environment and acceleration as well. The prototype works as the phone send data via mation-stream to the computer and according certain degrees the background changes colour. In order the prototype to work properly to phone should be placed on a table and gradually rotated 360ยบ on the right.**
