# PP and P2 Final Project
Physical Prototyping & Programming II joint final project: Group 6



**What is the project about**

The goal of the project is to explore ways to interact with and manipulate light to:
  - Turn it on/off
  - Change the hue
  - Change the brightness
  
The project however does not aim to design light, but specifically focuses on human interaction with sensors, collection of data through a serial bridge and use of that data to change the behaviour of lights.




**What is the project exploring**

Our group is exploring human interaction with lights in public spaces such as underpasses and similar settings in a city that are commonly considered to make one feel uneasy, unsafe and are generally avoided.
We are not to solve a public safety problem, but rather aim to explore ways to make poorly lit public spaces more playful through interaction and thus more acceptable for daily use as a pedestrian.




**How the project is useful**

The examples and code in this repository can be helpful for public space designers to explore different ways of interaction using serial bridge for quick and easy lo-fi prototyping.




**How users can get started with the project:**

Before starting, read the README files in every folder to get informed about what the examples do.  
Follow the serial-bridge README.md or motion-stream README.md files instructions.  
You might need to downgrade your node.js version for the examples to work.
