# PP and P2 Final Project
Physical Prototyping & Programming II joint final project: Group 6



**What is the project about**

The goal of the project is to explore possible ways to interact with and manipulate light to:
  - Turn it on/off
  - Change the hue
  - Change the brigthness
  
The project however does not aim to design light, but specifically focuses on human interaction with sensors, collection of data and using that data through a serial bridge to change the behaviour of lights.



**What is the project exploring**

Our group is exploring human interaction with lights in public spaces such as underpasses and similar settings in a city that are commonly considered to make one uncomfortable, feel unsafe and are generally avoided.
We are not to solve a public safety problem, but rather aim to explore ways to make poorly lit public spaces more playful through interaction and thus more acceptable for daily use.



**How the project is useful**

The examples and code in this repository can be helpful for public space designers to explore different ways of interaction using serial bridge for a quick and easy lo-fi prototyping.
