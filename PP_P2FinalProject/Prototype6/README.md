**Prototype6 Discription** 
- This prototype uses the ultrasonic sensor to measure distance and based on the distance different lights(LEDs) activates.
- We used the night rider arduino sketch combined with an edited sketch done by Christoffer. 
- When we had a working arduino sketch we sent the data to our computer via the serial bridge and used JavaScript to be able to communicate and change the lights on our arduino board. 
- We use this prototype to simulate an automated situation where lights turn on based on the proximity of the user.
